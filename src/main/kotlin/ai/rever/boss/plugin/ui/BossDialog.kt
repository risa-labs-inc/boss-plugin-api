/**
 * Whether the window hosting this composition is one that needs heavyweight overlays.
 *
 * **This declaration must stay in a file named `BossDialog.kt`.** Kotlin derives a top-level
 * declaration's JVM facade class from the FILE name, so the api dump records it as
 * `BossDialogKt.getLocalHeavyweightOverlays`. Moving it to `BossOverlayHost.kt` - its conceptual
 * home, and where a maintainer would naturally put it - renames the symbol to
 * `BossOverlayHostKt.getLocalHeavyweightOverlays`, and plugins compiled against the old name fail
 * with NoClassDefFoundError at first use while `apiCheck` stays green in the api repo. The same trap
 * applies to `shouldRouteHeavyweight` and to both `BossAlertDialog` overloads, whose `Color`
 * parameters additionally mangle their JVM names.
 *
 * Default false, provided `true` by the host's main application window only. Secondary windows
 * (Settings, the first-run setup window) contain no browser surface, and routing their dialogs
 * through an always-on-top window sized to the *main* window would place them over the wrong
 * window and leave them floating above it, since a heavyweight modal deliberately does not dismiss
 * when focus moves to another window of the same application.

 * they are drawn here, so the two look the same.
 *
 * The scrim is not decoration on the heavyweight path, it is the primary dismissal mechanism: a
 * click on the page does NOT produce an AWT focus transition (Chromium's native child window takes
 * focus without one), so focus loss alone never sees it. A modal without a scrim would not dismiss
 * on an in-page click.
 *
 * @param onDismissRequest Called on Escape, on a click outside the card, or when focus leaves the
 *   application. Not called when the caller's own buttons close the dialog.
 * @param properties `dismissOnClickOutside` is honoured on both paths; `dismissOnBackPress` maps
 *   to Escape, which the heavyweight window handles itself.

/**
 * Full-window scrim with the card centered on it.

 * through to the scrim and dismissing the dialog the user is filling in.
 *
 * **Input is refused until the pointer is known to be idle**, which is not belt-and-braces: a
 * heavyweight modal is a new window that appears directly UNDER the cursor, and the click that
 * opened it may still be in flight. Cmd-clicking a link in a terminal opened the link dialog with
 * the mouse button still down, and the release then landed on whichever option happened to sit
 * beneath the pointer and chose it - the user picked an option they never aimed at. The lightweight
 * path cannot do this: it draws inside the existing window, whose press it already saw.
 *
 * Two arming rules, and the ORDER of precedence between them is the whole correctness argument:
 *  - a pointer event with no button held arms it. That is the real signal, and it covers both the
 *    in-flight release and any stray movement.
 *  - the [INPUT_ARM_DELAY_MS] timer arms it ONLY IF no button is held at that moment. It exists
 *    purely for a dialog opened from the keyboard or a menu, where no pointer event may ever arrive
 *    and the first real click would otherwise be eaten.
 *
 * The timer must not arm unconditionally. A deliberate modifier-click is easily held longer than
 * 200ms, and the new window's first-frame latency counts against that budget too, so an
 * unconditional timer can expire while the button is still down - reinstating the reported bug and
 * making it rarer, which is worse than leaving it. See [shouldArmModalInput].

 * content color, so a caller that styles its own `Text` keeps whatever it set.
 *
 * @param confirmButton The primary action. Rendered last, i.e. rightmost.
 * @param dismissButton The secondary action, rendered to the left of [confirmButton].
 * @param shape Card shape; null takes the design system's dialog radius.
