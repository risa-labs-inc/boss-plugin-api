/**
 * UI-thread-only handshake; [focus] invokes its callback synchronously on the caller thread.
 * The browser package is shared parent-first. On newer hosts the host-compiled copy runs;
 * older hosts use the API JAR copy, which remains unclaimed and keeps the in-tab toolbar.
 * API 1.0.94 makes these types available; native hosting additionally requires a supporting host.
 * Future member additions need a host release and minBossVersion gating.
 *
 * Plugins pair every [publish] with [remove] during composition disposal, including unload.
 * Hosts independently own window claims and focus registrations and must release both on disposal.
 * Browser publication cleanup deliberately cannot release a host-owned focus registration.
 * A browser hides its toolbar when its window or handle is hosted.
