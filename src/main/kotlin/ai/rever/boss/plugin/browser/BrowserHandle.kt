     * **Deprecated and now a no-op that always returns false. Fill through [executeJavaScript]
     * instead, targeting the element you already identified.** Scheduled for removal.
     *
     * The signature is the problem: it cannot say WHICH field, so the host had to guess, and the
     * guess was wrong in the ways real login pages are actually built. Measured on
     * `accounts.google.com`:
     *
     * - That page carries a `display: none` password input. The guess took the first
     *   `input[type="password"]` in the DOM - that one - so the password went into a hidden field
     *   and the screen did not change.
     * - The visible identifier box was missed entirely. The selector was
     *   `[autocomplete="username"]`, an exact attribute match, and the field declares
     *   `autocomplete="username webauthn"`; `autocomplete` is a space-separated token list per the
     *   HTML spec.
     * - The last-resort strategy was "first text input in a `<form>` containing a password". That
     *   page has no `<form>` element at all.
     *
     * Fixing the guess was tried first. It is not worth keeping, because every caller already knows
     * what the guess was reconstructing: a right-click menu was raised on a specific field, and an
     * autofill suggestion is anchored to a specific box. Filling that element is strictly better
     * information than a heuristic can recover, which puts credential filling on the caller's side
     * of the boundary along with the rules for deciding a field is real - notably that a candidate
     * must be tested for a layout box rather than trusted for being in the DOM. See fluck-browser's
     * `CredentialFill` for a worked implementation.
     *
     * **Why a no-op body rather than deletion.** Removing it outright would have made every caller
     * compiled against an older api throw `NoSuchMethodError` at the call site. That is survivable
     * where the call is guarded, and fluck-browser 1.2.19 does guard it - but 1.2.18 and earlier
     * call it bare inside a `launch`, where an `Error` reaches the coroutine uncaught and the host
     * tears the whole plugin down, closing every open browser tab. Since `minBossVersion` gates
     * plugin updates and the api plugin has no such gate, a user on an older host can receive this
     * api while pinned to a fluck-browser that would crash on it. Returning false gives every one
     * of those builds a silent no-op instead, which is also strictly better than what they do
     * today - writing a password into a hidden input.
     *
     * **Where the no-op actually takes effect.** [BrowserHandle] is `@HostImplemented`: the host
     * compiles in its own copy and serves it parent-first, so this jar's body is shadowed at
     * runtime. Changing it here is a compile-time signal to plugin authors - the behaviour change
     * arrives with the BossConsole release that carries the matching copy. Gate on
     * `minBossVersion`, not `minApiVersion`.
