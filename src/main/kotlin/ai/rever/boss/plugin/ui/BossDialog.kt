 * declaration's JVM facade class from the FILE name, so the api dump records it as
 * `BossDialogKt.getLocalHeavyweightOverlays`. Moving it to `BossOverlayHost.kt` - its conceptual
 * home, and where a maintainer would naturally put it - renames the symbol to
 * `BossOverlayHostKt.getLocalHeavyweightOverlays`, and plugins compiled against the old name fail
 * with NoClassDefFoundError at first use while `apiCheck` stays green in the api repo. The same trap
 * applies to `shouldRouteHeavyweight` and to both `BossAlertDialog` overloads, whose `Color`
 * parameters additionally mangle their JVM names.
 *
 * Default false, provided `true` by the host's main application window only. Secondary windows
 * (Settings, the first-run setup window) contain no browser surface, and routing their dialogs
 * through an always-on-top window sized to the *main* window would place them over the wrong
 * window and leave them floating above it, since a heavyweight modal deliberately does not dismiss
 * when focus moves to another window of the same application.

 * heavyweight modal is a new window that appears directly UNDER the cursor, and the click that
 * opened it may still be in flight. Cmd-clicking a link in a terminal opened the link dialog with
 * the mouse button still down, and the release then landed on whichever option happened to sit
 * beneath the pointer and chose it - the user picked an option they never aimed at. The lightweight
 * path cannot do this: it draws inside the existing window, whose press it already saw.
 *
 * Two arming rules, and the ORDER of precedence between them is the whole correctness argument:
 *  - a pointer event with no button held arms it. That is the real signal, and it covers both the
 *    in-flight release and any stray movement.
 *  - the [INPUT_ARM_DELAY_MS] timer arms it ONLY IF no button is held at that moment. It exists
 *    purely for a dialog opened from the keyboard or a menu, where no pointer event may ever arrive
 *    and the first real click would otherwise be eaten.
 *
 * The timer must not arm unconditionally. A deliberate modifier-click is easily held longer than
 * 200ms, and the new window's first-frame latency counts against that budget too, so an
 * unconditional timer can expire while the button is still down - reinstating the reported bug and
 * making it rarer, which is worse than leaving it. See [shouldArmModalInput].

 * screen coordinates has to go through the content pane rather than the window and is off by the
 * title-bar height otherwise. For a menu opened by a click the two coincide. For a control anchored
 * somewhere the pointer is not - a suggestion list under a text field being the case that exposes it
 * - the cursor currently wins, and that is a host-side limitation rather than part of this contract:
 * the parameter is already here, so a renderer that learns true window-space anchoring needs no api
 * change. Do not rely on cursor placement.

 * The anchor rect converted from Compose PIXELS to AWT logical units (dp).
 *
 * The unit change is the entire point and is easy to miss: layout coordinates are in pixels, while the
 * host places overlay content with `absoluteOffset(x.dp, y.dp)` in logical units. Passing pixels
 * straight through put the URL-bar suggestion list at roughly double its intended position on a 2x
 * display - correct on a 1x screen, visibly wrong on every Retina one, which is exactly the class of
 * bug the host's own popup code already carries a warning about.
 *
 * Takes position and size rather than a Rect because the caller must use `positionInWindow()`, which
 * is UNCLIPPED. `boundsInWindow()` clips, and a zero-size probe then collapses to an empty rect at the
 * origin - which placed the suggestion list in the screen's top-left corner rather than under the URL
 * bar.
 *
 * Pure, and separate from the composable, so the conversion is pinned by a test at more than one
 * scale factor rather than only by looking at a 1x screen.
